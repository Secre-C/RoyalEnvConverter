# RoyalEnvConverter
 This Program Converts Royal Env's to a format that can be used in Vanilla P5 and by that, I mean it copy pastes values from a target royal env to a vanilla env
 
 In order to use, you'll need .NET 3.1
 
 To use it, copy a file to the same directory as the programs .exe and copy the name without the extension (easy way to do it is click on the file, hit F2, then hit CTRL + C).
 
 Double Click the .exe and paste the name of the env in the .exe's root directory, and the file should magically spawn in the newly created "output" folder.
