# RoyalEnvConverter
 This Program Converts Royal Env's to a format that can be used in Vanilla P5 and by that, I mean it copy pastes values from a target royal env to a vanilla env
 
In order to use, you'll need .NET 3.1
 
 To use it, copy your ENVs to the input folder, then just run the program. If the program detects that vanilla compatible ENVs are present, it'll ask if you want to convert those as well. It'll only ask once per instance, and it's not recommended that you say yes. The converted ENVs will be put into output/input/ (I'm too lazy to fix it, sue me).

 While most converted Envs will look fairly accurate compared to their actual royal counterparts, some do take advantage of the new values added in Royal, so some new fields may not look right (002_016 for example).

Removed the release section, you can still download it via the code thingy, preferably using the desktop app so you can keep it up to date.
