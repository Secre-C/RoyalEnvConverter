# RoyalEnvConverter
This Program Converts Royal Env's to a format that can be used in Vanilla P5 and by that, I mean it copy pastes values from a target royal env to a vanilla env

In order to use, you'll need .NET 3.1

To use it, copy your ENVs to the input folder, then just run the program. If the program detects that vanilla compatible ENVs are present, it'll skip'em. output goes into output/input (idk why, too lazy to look into it)
